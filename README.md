# sms_spam_detector - Module 21 Challenge

This challenge involves building a Support Vector Classifiction (SVC) model to distinguish spam text messages from non-spam text messages.  The solution will also include a Gradio UI to accept manally-entered text messages from a user and then display the app's spam or no-spam evaluation.

## Source
All code is based on templates provided, and is my work.

## Where is the code?
The code module, gradio_sms_text_classification.ipynb, is in the top level folder of my "sms_spam_detector" repo.
